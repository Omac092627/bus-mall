# bus-mall

This is a blatant rip-off of SkyMall. Not to be used for actual distribution, just to show what your boy can do.

I decided to try and make the site pop because it was mad-bland. Like, seriously dense. It was atrocious. Box shadows are your friend.

I added a chart using chartjs, SHOUT-OUT CHARTJS, thank you for allowing me to beautify my site. Although the syntax was a bit confusing. I managed to change the border widths so the colors "pop" and the user can see what they voted on the most. Honestly, chartjs is a great tool, but the learning curve is barnone. Using the chart, I created an array to store my pictures and passed in a few different colors to render for the borders.

There are only 20 pictures to choose from and honestly, the baby is the most adorable. 

I attempted to structure the code in app.js to allow for an easy read. My brain isn't the most powerful so please bear with me as you descend through the madness.
